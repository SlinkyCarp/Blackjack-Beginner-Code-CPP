# Blackjack-Beginner-Code-CPP
This is a beginner level C++ code to make the Blackjack casino game using classes and functions. The code may be lengthy but it is fairly easy to read and understand. There is a lot of room for improvement to make the code better and concise.

This project was worked on by Ciaran Downes, Nick-Ashley and myself.

<u>I would appreciate tips on how to make this more concise as well. Drop a comment!</u>
